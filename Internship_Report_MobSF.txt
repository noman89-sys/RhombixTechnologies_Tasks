Mobile Application Security Assessment Report
Internship Domain: Cyber Security Intern
Company: Rhombix Technologies
Intern Name: [Muhammad |Noman]

1. Introduction
This report presents the findings of a security assessment conducted on an intentionally vulnerable mobile banking application using Mobile Security Framework (MobSF).
The purpose of this task was to identify vulnerabilities related to insecure data storage, insecure communication, and weak authentication mechanisms in accordance with the internship requirements.

2. Tools and Environment
- Operating System: Kali Linux
- Security Assessment Tool: Mobile Security Framework (MobSF)
- Target Application: Insecure Banking App (test APK)

3. Methodology
3.1 Static Analysis with MobSF
The APK file was uploaded into MobSF for automated security scanning.
The Static Analysis Report was examined to identify:
- Hardcoded credentials and API keys
- Weak or outdated cryptographic algorithms
- Unnecessary and risky Android permissions
- Insecure coding patterns related to data handling

4. Findings
4.1 Static Analysis Results (MobSF)
- Hardcoded Sensitive Data: API keys and fixed credentials present in source code.
- Weak Hashing Algorithm: MD5 used for password hashing, which is insecure.
- Over-Permissioning: Application requests permissions (SMS, contacts, location) beyond what is required for its core functionality.

5. Recommendations
- Use secure cryptographic algorithms (SHA-256 with salt for hashing, AES for encryption).
- Remove all hardcoded credentials and API keys from the codebase.
- Restrict permissions to only what is necessary for core functionality.
- Follow OWASP Mobile Security Guidelines to improve overall app security posture.

6. Conclusion
The MobSF analysis revealed several vulnerabilities in the mobile banking application, primarily related to insecure data handling, weak cryptography, and excessive permissions.
Addressing these issues will greatly enhance the application's security and reduce exposure to potential attacks.
